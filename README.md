# DMOJ

This repository houses solutions for DMOJ problems. Problems will be organized by their problem code. For example, the problem with code `ccc00j1`
refers to the problem at www.dmoj.ca/problem/ccc01j1.

All code here will be written in Java, my language of choice. Note that some of the problems on DMOJ may not be solvable in Java. I try and write my problems without fast-IO, so code here will generally use `BufferedReader` and `StringTokenizer`. There will probably not be any comments in the code

Note that some problems here may not actually be functional

**A note on problem names:
  Sometimes DMOJ starts problem codes with a number. This is not allowed in Java. Those files will be prefixed with `_`**
  (eg. The problem [16 Bit S/W Only (16bitswonly)](http://www.dmoj.ca/problem/16bitswonly) will be named under `_16bitswonly`).
  
  Problems with multiple solutions will be suffixed with `_solutiontype`. For example, a problem with a secondary brute-force solution would be noted as `problemcode_bf`

### Bruteforcable Problems

It isn't everyday that you see a problem that is bruteforcable in Java
